            "content": "Automobili Lamborghini and CULTI MILANO joined forces to give birth to the new special edition created by the artist Francesco Poroli, who has interpreted the collaboration between the two Italian brands and the fragrance made exclusively for Lamborghini with his unmistakable style. Poroli’s work decorates the 1000 ml Decor fragrance dispenser and its case with a series of sharp and snappy lines inspired by the design of the super sports cars.What explodes from the circle on the front of the dispenser is a world at the same time made of straight lines representing Lamborghini’s speed and energy, and gradations that conjure up the diffusion of the fragrance of CULTI MILANO.The perfect synthesis of two Italian excellences contained in a gem of art and design. On this subject, the artist said, “I developed this project observing a reverent and scrupulous attention to detail.Like in a Lamborghini super sports car where every single screw, element and detail seems to have a sense and a meaning.They perfectly combine with engineering talent to bring a dream to life.An identical approach is taken also for the CULTI MILANO world, whose prestige revolves around having introduced into man’s lifestyle the living culture, in which places aesthetically wear fragrance.”"

Colour, speed, power, sound and excitement: this renowned motorsport photographer has captured the unique features of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo’s unrivalled star. The Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2 has the characteristic ‘omega’ lip, a completely overhauled chassis and a unique sound created by a carbon duct and custom-made exhaust system. All this makes it the perfect subject for a photographer with a unique vision like Heath, whose work includes some of the most striking portraits of F1 drivers. “My special style is strongly influenced by an understanding of composition, using light to accentuate the subject, the photographer explains. I look for a clean, simple image, often using a shallow depth of field technique, and I have an 'old school' approach to making the image work as much as possible on-camera without having to rely on post-production software”. Heath followed a lap of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo at the Paul Ricard Le Castellet racetrack in the South of France. And who better to capture the more abstract elements of the Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2 at full throttle?"

The collaboration began in 2013, and the renewal comes with many new, exclusive features.The Lamborghini exhibition space on the ground floor of the airport terminal has undergone complete restyling and now features a permanent display of a Lamborghini vehicle, among other things. Furthermore, the Follow Me Car accompanying planes to and from the runway is now a Huracán EVO with a brand-new yellow-and-black livery. Finally, travelers who pre-book Marconi Airport’s VIP service can enjoy exclusive transportation in the form of a Lamborghini Urus that will escort them from the runway to the terminal and vice versa. “This special collaboration continues between our company and Bologna Airport,” remarked Stephan Winkelmann, Chairman and CEO of Automobili Lamborghini. “The presence of Lamborghini in this hub has a two-fold value: the relationship with the territory that is home to us and with which we have strong bonds, but also an important ‘business card’ for passengers who come from all over the world and who will have the chance to appreciate our brand up close. A link with the local but with a global vision, therefore right in step with Lamborghini philosophy.”"
