        content: 'Automobili Lamborghini and CULTI MILANO joined forces to give birth to the new special edition created by the artist Francesco Poroli, who has interpreted the collaboration between the two Italian brands and the fragrance made exclusively for Lamborghini with his unmistakable style. Poroli’s work decorates the 1000 ml Decor fragrance dispenser and its case with a series of sharp and snappy lines inspired by the design of the super sports cars.What explodes from the circle on the front of the dispenser is a world at the same time made of straight lines representing Lamborghini’s speed and energy, and gradations that conjure up the diffusion of the fragrance of CULTI MILANO.The perfect synthesis of two Italian excellences contained in a gem of art and design. On this subject, the artist said, “I developed this project observing a reverent and scrupulous attention to detail.Like in a Lamborghini super sports car where every single screw, element and detail seems to have a sense and a meaning.They perfectly combine with engineering talent to bring a dream to life.An identical approach is taken also for the CULTI MILANO world, whose prestige revolves around having introduced into man’s lifestyle the living culture, in which places aesthetically wear fragrance.”'

        content: 'The Lamborghini Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2 has never looked as amazing as in Darren Heath*s shots.Colour, speed, power, sound and excitement: this renowned motorsport photographer has captured the unique features of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo’s unrivalled star.The Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2 has the characteristic ‘omega’ lip, a completely overhauled chassis and a unique sound created by a carbon duct and custom- made exhaust system.All this makes it the perfect subject for a photographer with a unique vision like Heath, whose work includes some of the most striking portraits of F1 drivers. “My special style is strongly influenced by an understanding of composition, using light to accentuate the subject, the photographer explains.I look for a clean, simple image, often using a shallow depth of field technique, and I have an *old school* approach to making the image work as much as possible on - camera without having to rely on post - production software”. Heath followed a lap of the Lamborghini Super Trofeo at the Paul Ricard Le Castellet racetrack in the South of France.And who better to capture the more abstract elements of the Huracán Super Trofeo EVO2 at full throttle ?
